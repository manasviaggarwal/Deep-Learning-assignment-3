# deeplearning_3
To test both the models, run main.py which will run tfidf_test.py and deep_model_test.py to test logistic regression and deep learning models respectively.
Also, tfidf_train.py is the code used for traning task 1 i.e. logistic regression model and deep_model_train.py is the code used to train deep learning (RNN) model.
To run these files, please add the dataset and the pretrained glove weights from the links given in the report. model directory contains both the trained models and tfidf.txt and deep_model.txt are the output files of logistic regression and deep learning (RNN) models respectively.
